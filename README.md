# HZAM-2D

HZAM-2D (Hybrid Zone with Assortative Mating) is a system for modelling the behaviour of a 
hybrid zone arising from secondary contact between two species.

## Package features
- Run hybrid zone simulations with a wide variety of different parameters (hybrid fitness, strength of assortative mating, amount of ecological difference, etc.)
- Track different variables over time (gene flow, population overlap, cline width, etc.)
- Save the results in JLD2 or CSV format
- Create plots showing how variables change over time or how changing the hybrid fitnesss and assortative mating parameters affect the outcome of the simulation.

The code was written by Darren Irwin and Jack Farley. You are welcome to use these scripts; if you do, please site the paper above (and perhaps also this GitHub repository).

To produce the paper figures, the data files are needed, and these are too big for Github. They will be included in a Dryad archive, after the paper is submitted to a journal.
