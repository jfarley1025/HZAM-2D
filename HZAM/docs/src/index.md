HZAM (Hybrid Zone with Assortative Mating) is a system for modelling the behaviour of a 
hybrid zone arising from secondary contact between two species.

## Package features
- Run hybrid zone simulations with a wide variety of different parameters (hybrid fitness, strength of assortative mating, amount of ecological difference, etc.)
- Track different variables over time (gene flow, population overlap, cline width, etc.)
- Save the results in JLD2 or CSV format
- Create plots showing how variables change over time or how changing the hybrid fitnesss and assortative mating parameters affect the outcome of the simulation.
